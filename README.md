# GraphicsComputingProject

This school project was done with another student. Its main purpose was to create a scene in C++ using our own shaders (both vertex shader and fragment shader) in GLSL. We create a very strange atmosphere in space, where two flying men are playing table tennis with a color changing ball.

Only the code in C++ and the shaders are available here, because the project fundations was a code skeleton we don't have the rights on.
